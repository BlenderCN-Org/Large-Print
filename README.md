Large-Print
===========

Adapted large print plugin for Blender to suit my needs.

I've no idea if this has been updated and looked after since it worked w/ Blender 2.54, but I find it fairly useful for quick poster rendering. I've tweaked it so it can render 36x28 in @ 300dpi. Good for printing posters.

The plugin was originally called: Render to Print http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Extensions:2.6/Py/Scripts/Render/Render_to_Print
